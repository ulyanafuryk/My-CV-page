          <h2>A little about me:</h2>
          <p>I was born in the village of Sokilnyky not far from Lviv.
          <br>My first social work began with the organization
          <br>Prosvitnycka spilka when i was 14. After that i desided 
          <br>to be a lawyer to defend the rights of people.
          <br>Most of all I'm interested in Art, photography and rules 
          <br>between people which are by them generated.
          <br>Also I have a great desire to understand the world of Information technology
          <br>and management as it is the future of our society!
          <br>So, have a nice nime and contact for legal aid:)
